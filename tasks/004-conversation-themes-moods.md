## Implementation Summary
Created 3 distinct AI tutor personality modes with Hebrew UI:

**Modified [tutorInstructions.js](../shared/tutorInstructions.js):**
- Extracted base tutor rules shared across all modes
- Created 3 mode-specific instruction sets:
  - **Happy Mode**: Extra cheerful, uses excitement words ("Amazing!", "Wonderful!", "Yay!"), celebrates every answer
  - **Story Mode**: Interactive storytelling, creates short stories with family/pets, asks "what happens next?"
  - **Question Mode**: Asks lots of follow-up questions, uses "why/how/what", encourages longer responses
- Each mode has custom greeting and specific personality traits
- Exported all modes: `happyModeInstructions`, `storyModeInstructions`, `questionModeInstructions`

**Created [ModeSelector.jsx](../client/components/ModeSelector.jsx):**
- 3-button grid layout with Hebrew labels
- Visual mode cards with emoji (🎉 שמח, 📖 סיפורים, 🤔 שאלות)
- Color-coded (yellow/purple/blue) with hover states
- Disabled during active sessions (can only select before connecting)
- Shows checkmark on selected mode
- Smooth scale animation on selection

**Modified [ToolPanel.jsx](../client/components/ToolPanel.jsx):**
- Added mode selection state management
- Maps mode IDs to instruction sets via `MODE_INSTRUCTIONS`
- Dynamically creates `sessionUpdateConfig` based on selected mode
- Displays ModeSelector in both active and inactive states
- Logs selected mode for debugging

**Features:**
- Mode selection persists until user changes it
- Modes locked during active session (prevents mid-session changes)
- Each mode creates distinct conversation personality
- Hebrew UI for child-friendly interface
- Visual feedback on selection
