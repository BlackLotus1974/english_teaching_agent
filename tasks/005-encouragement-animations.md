## Description
Visual celebrations when AI gives praise. Confetti, sparkles, bounce animations.

## Why
Visual reward for participation and correct pronunciation. Instant positive feedback.

## Implementation Notes
- Detect praise keywords from AI transcripts ("Great job!", "Well done!", "Perfect!")
- Trigger CSS/canvas animations:
  - Confetti particles
  - Sparkle effects around avatar
  - Bounce/scale animations
  - Star burst effects
- Keep animations short (1-2 seconds) and non-disruptive

## Subtasks
- [x] Create animation components (confetti, sparkles, etc.)
- [x] Set up keyword detection from AI events
- [x] Trigger animations on praise detection
- [x] Add CSS animations for avatar reactions
- [x] Test animation performance
- [x] Ensure animations don't interfere with conversation

## Implementation Summary
Created comprehensive encouragement animation system with keyword detection:

**Created [EncouragementAnimations.jsx](../client/components/EncouragementAnimations.jsx):**
- **Confetti Component**: 50 colored particles falling from top with rotation animation
- **Sparkles Component**: 20 sparkle emojis appearing around center of screen
- **StarBurst Component**: Single large star that scales and rotates
- **PraiseBanner Component**: Animated banner showing praise message at top

**Modified [App.jsx](../client/components/App.jsx):**
- Added state management for all 4 animation types
- Implemented keyword detection from `response.audio_transcript.delta` events
- Three-tier praise system:
  - **High praise** ("perfect", "excellent", "amazing", "wonderful") → Confetti + Banner + Excited emotion
  - **Medium praise** ("great job", "well done", "good job", "very good") → Sparkles + Banner + Happy emotion
  - **Light praise** ("good", "nice", "that's right", "correct") → Star burst + Encouraging emotion
- All animations are pointer-events-none (non-blocking)
- Auto-dismiss after 1-2 seconds

**Features:**
- Animations triggered by AI praise in real-time
- Multiple animation types based on praise intensity
- Coordinated with avatar emotions
- Non-intrusive overlay animations
- CSS-only animations for performance
- Automatic cleanup after animations complete
