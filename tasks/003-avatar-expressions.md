# Task 003: Avatar Expressions

**Status:** ✅ completed
**Priority:** high
**Created:** 2025-10-04
**Completed:** 2025-10-04

## Description
Make the AI avatar feel ALIVE with reactive facial expressions. Huge emotional engagement for minimal code.

## Why
Kids bond with characters that react to them. Creates emotional connection.

## Implementation Notes
- Add emotion-based morph target animations
- Detect conversation state (listening, speaking, celebrating)
- Map emotions to morph targets (happy, excited, thinking, proud)
- Smooth transitions between expressions
- React to pronunciation corrections and praise

## Subtasks
- [x] Identify available morph targets for emotions
- [x] Create expression state machine
- [x] Implement emotion detection from AI events
- [x] Animate morph targets for emotions
- [x] Add idle expressions (blinking, subtle movements)
- [x] Test emotional responses

## Implementation Summary
Enhanced [Avatar3D.jsx](../client/components/Avatar3D.jsx) with emotional expression system:
- Created emotion mapping with 6 states (neutral, happy, encouraging, thinking, excited, listening)
- Each emotion maps to specific morph targets (mouthSmile, browInnerUp, eyeWide, mouthFunnel, etc.)
- Smooth transitions between emotions using THREE.MathUtils.lerp with 0.1 interpolation
- Implemented realistic blinking animation (every 3-5 seconds with sine wave)
- Blinking uses eyeBlinkLeft, eyeBlinkRight, eyesClosed morph targets

Modified [App.jsx](../client/components/App.jsx) to drive emotions:
- Added avatarEmotion and isAvatarListening state
- Emotion detection based on AI events:
  - response.created → happy
  - response.audio.delta → neutral
  - input_audio_buffer.speech_started → listening state
  - input_audio_buffer.speech_stopped → thinking
  - response.done → encouraging (returns to neutral after 2s)
- Passed emotion and isListening props to Avatar3D

Features:
- Lip sync preserved and works additively with emotions
- Listening state overrides emotion when child is speaking
- Smooth emotion transitions prevent jarring changes
- Automatic blinking adds realism

## Dependencies
- Avatar GLB must have emotion morph targets

## Estimated Effort
Medium-High (4-5 hours)
