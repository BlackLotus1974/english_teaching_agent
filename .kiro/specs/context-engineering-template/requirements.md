# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a comprehensive Context Engineering Template that provides developers with a structured framework for building effective AI context systems. The template will serve as a guide for understanding, implementing, and optimizing context engineering practices across different AI applications, with specific focus on the OpenAI Realtime Console application as a reference implementation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working with AI systems, I want a comprehensive context engineering template, so that I can systematically design and implement effective context management for my AI applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer accesses the template THEN the system SHALL provide a complete header section with title, purpose, and key principles
2. WHEN reviewing the template THEN the system SHALL include all 7 essential context components (Instructions, User Prompt, State/History, Long-term Memory, Retrieved Information, Available Tools, Structured Output)
3. WHEN implementing context engineering THEN the system SHALL provide a step-by-step planning framework
4. WHEN evaluating context quality THEN the system SHALL offer clear assessment criteria
5. WHEN working with different use cases THEN the system SHALL include example scenarios and template sections

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer analyzing existing applications, I want detailed exploration of the current app structure, so that I can understand how context engineering applies to real-world implementations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exploring the application THEN the system SHALL analyze the OpenAI Realtime Console architecture
2. WHEN documenting the app THEN the system SHALL identify key components including React frontend, Express backend, WebRTC integration, and 3D avatar system
3. WHEN reviewing functionality THEN the system SHALL document the English tutoring chatbot implementation
4. WHEN analyzing context flow THEN the system SHALL map how user interactions, session management, and AI responses work together

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer implementing context engineering, I want practical implementation guidance, so that I can avoid common pitfalls and follow best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing context systems THEN the system SHALL provide best practices documentation
2. WHEN encountering issues THEN the system SHALL identify common pitfalls and their solutions
3. WHEN designing context flows THEN the system SHALL offer implementation notes and recommendations
4. WHEN optimizing performance THEN the system SHALL provide quality assessment criteria and optimization strategies

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer working with different AI use cases, I want example scenarios and templates, so that I can adapt the context engineering approach to my specific needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN working with conversational AI THEN the system SHALL provide relevant template sections
2. WHEN implementing real-time applications THEN the system SHALL offer WebRTC and audio processing context examples
3. WHEN building educational applications THEN the system SHALL include tutoring and learning context patterns
4. WHEN integrating 3D interfaces THEN the system SHALL document avatar and visual feedback context considerations
